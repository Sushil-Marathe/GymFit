<h1>Hanging Dumbbell Rows</h1><br>
<h2> Body part:Back</h2><br>
<h2>Description</h2><br>
<p>1) Take a dumbbell in your hand and let the weight hang down below you, 
<br>feeling the serratus muscles stretch to their maximum when performing the hanging dumbbell rows exercise.</p>
<p>2) Concentrating on using the serratus muscles in isolation as much as possible, lift the dumbbell up in front of you.</p>
<p>3) As you lift, your elbows come toward the front, no out to the side.</p>
<p>4) Hold at the point of maximum serratus contraction, then lower the dumbbells slowly back to the starting position, feeling the serratus muscles stretch once more. 
<br>During the hanging dumbbell rows movement, be sure to keep your elbows and the dumbbells as close to your body as possible.</p>

<p>1) Walk to the bar. Stand with your mid-foot under the bar. Don't touch it with your shins. Medium stance, toes pointing out.</p>
<p>2) Grab the bar, use a medium grip width. Narrower than on Bench Press, wider than on Deadlifts. Hold the bar low in your hands.</p>
<p>3) Unlock your knees, Keep your hips higher than on the Deadlift. Bend your knees but keep them back so the bar can't hit them.</p>
<p>4) Lift your chest, straighten your back, don't move the bar. Don't drop your hips. Don't squeeze your shoulder-blades together. </p>

<h1>Seated Rows</h1><br>
<h2> Body parts:Back</h2><br>
<h2>Description</h2><br>
<p>1) Sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.</p>
 <p>2) Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.</p>
<p>3) With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. </p>
<br>Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. 
<br> This is the starting position of the exercise.</p>
<p>4) Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. 
<br>At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in</p>
